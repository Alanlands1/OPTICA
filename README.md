Blindness Detection due to Diabetic Retinopathy using deep learning

Diabetic retinopathy damages the blood vessels in retina. It is a disease that cause vision loss. It is usually seen in two categories of people one is the diabetic patients and other is the working age adult population.No symptoms can be seen during the early stage of this disease, so it progresses and loss of vision occurs.This problem can be solved only by the early detection of disease and its timely treatment. 

In the proposed system, we plan to build a deep learning model to speed up disease detection.
The models were trained using the architectures Resnet, Densenet etc. After testing and retraining the model will be used to develop the system that have a user friendly interference. 

Code for training the model is given in the folder "Model"
